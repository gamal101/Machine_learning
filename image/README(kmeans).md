Emotion Recognition with KMeans Clustering
This repository contains code for performing emotion recognition using Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) features and KMeans clustering.

Overview
The additional code focuses on:

Applying feature scaling to HOG features.
Utilizing KMeans clustering for classification.
Evaluating the accuracy and performance of KMeans clustering for emotion recognition.
Requirements
Ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.x
Libraries:
pandas
scikit-learn
skimage
numpy
seaborn
matplotlib
Usage
Addition to Emotion Recognition Script:

Incorporate the provided code into your existing Emotion Recognition script.
Make necessary adjustments based on your dataset and requirements.
Running the KMeans Clustering:

This segment applies feature scaling to HOG features and uses KMeans clustering for classification.
Execute the script to observe accuracy and confusion matrices.
Instructions
Feature Scaling:

The script scales HOG features using StandardScaler from scikit-learn.
KMeans Clustering:

KMeans clustering is applied to scaled HOG features.
The script evaluates accuracy and generates a confusion matrix for the clustering-based classification.
Results
Accuracy using KMeans as a classifier with feature scaling.
Confusion Matrix for KMeans-based Classification.
Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curve using KMeans for emotion recognition.
Note
Ensure paths, parameters, and data are correctly set according to your dataset.
This code snippet assumes you've already extracted HOG features and have a labeled dataset.
