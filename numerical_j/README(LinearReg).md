
Absolutely! Here's another README file template tailored to the provided regression model code:

Housing Price Prediction - Regression Models
This repository contains code for predicting housing prices using regression models like Linear Regression and K-Nearest Neighbors Regression.

Overview
The script focuses on:

Loading housing data and preprocessing it for regression models.
Implementing a Linear Regression model for housing price prediction.
Evaluating model performance using evaluation metrics and visualization.
Requirements
Ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.x
Libraries:
pandas
scikit-learn
matplotlib
seaborn
Usage
Dataset Preparation:

Ensure the housing dataset ('housing.csv') is available.
The script handles missing values in numeric columns by filling them with medians.
Regression Model Implementation:

The code creates a preprocessing pipeline for numeric and categorical features.
Implements a Linear Regression model for housing price prediction.
Running the Script:

Execute the script and observe the model's accuracy, scatter plot, and evaluation metrics.
Instructions
Preprocessing:

Numeric columns are scaled using StandardScaler and missing values are filled with medians.
Categorical columns are encoded using OneHotEncoder.
Model Evaluation:

The script calculates R-squared and Mean Squared Error (MSE) for model evaluation.
It displays a scatter plot depicting actual vs. predicted housing prices.
Results
Linear Regression Score on test data.
Scatter plot illustrating the relationship between actual and predicted housing prices.
Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared on test data for Linear Regression.
Note
Ensure the dataset is correctly formatted and accessible.
Modify hyperparameters or models as needed for experimentation or improvement.
